# INTRODUCTION
#
# This ESPHome based firmware configuration is designed for the CircuitSetup Security+ Garage Door Opener, which is built on the ESP32-S3.
# It allows you to use a Security+ Garage Door Opener in Home Assistant, and adds the following:
#
# 1. Gets opened/closed door state and obstruction sensor data
# 2. Emulates a Security+ garage door opener button.
# 3. Adds a Garage Door "Cover" entity that is exposed to Home Assistant. The cover entity incorporates the state of the
#    garage door and controls to open/close/stop it.
# 4. Adds control of opener light
# 5. Flashes an onboard LED and beeps an onboard piezo sounder as a warning before automatically closing.

  # NAME
  # By default, the name of the ESPHome device is "circuitsetup-gdo-xxxxxx" where xxxxxx is a unique identifier. The device's
  # hostname on your network is also defined by the name, defaulting to "circuitsetup-gdo-xxxxxx.local". Edit this variable to
  # customize the name and hostname. Note: only lowercase characters, numbers and hyphen(-) are allowed.
